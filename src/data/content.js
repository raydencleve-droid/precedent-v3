        "“History shapes the world today” is a cliché phrase reiterated by historians, but have you ever thoroughly explored why or how decisions made yesterday or even millennia ago still shape the world today?",
        "“Historian Peter Stearns argued that facts and knowledge help distinguish the educated from the uneducated, Civilized and the uncivilized”. Without any forms of evidence, any study requires a sufficient amount of proof to prove otherwise; there must be advocacy and a justification behind the following circumstance. But how are we able to recognize the world if we have not recognized the past? Historical knowledge and awareness are the stepping stones towards interpreting the present, the only key and pathway to understand how outcomes and certain decisions have revolutionized the world and the borders we stand in today. History is not only about what has happened in the past, history does not solve world hunger. Consequently, history provides a concrete framework to interpret and rationally decide settlements, diplomacy in order not to repeat the past.",
        "Understanding history is not hard, but committing to properly diving into these events and precedents is what jeopardizes the main message of history. History should not be considered a facade of memorization, as individuals develop the ability to critically analyze and evaluate current situations according to patterns that have occurred."

        "History, as referred to in the Oxford Dictionary, refers to the whole series of past events connected with someone or something. This accounts for all the information present and related during the time. History not only shows how evolutions have developed over the years, but about how societies and people behave despite their living conditions.",
        "History is not always about wars, disputes, or diplomatic misdemeanors, but rather the operation of relying on a reference to the past. How can we understand our ancestors if we’re not aware of the history and the background of our blood? Everything in life relies on and refers back to history. Some medical attempts to establish theories regarding human responses and behaviour are also limited due to the lack of historical references. History is not perfect, but history helps everyone understand the only evidence base to contemplate and analyze the decisions that have renewed the world we live in today. All diplomatic efforts by past leaders, to even the theory of evolution that was created by Charles Darwin, provide a foundation of how all individuals, regardless of culture, race, function from time to time."

Historical precedents provide a fair opportunity to talk not based on theory or hearsay, but rather on historical groups, charts about how families, groups, or institutions were formed decades ago. Understanding the history of a family provides a chance for us to understand the identity and facts about what and how the family has interacted with larger historical changes.",
        "Furthermore, history also provides a stage for young individuals to deep thinkers to contemplate their moral points of view and how certain situations in the past address the problem according to the real complexities of each individual, regardless of the setting. Studying history through this website aims for improved decision-making and reflection through analyzing and studying existing cases."

        brief: "Between the Indian and Pacific oceans lies a crossroad between 10 separating Islands consisting of countries Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar/Burma, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, Timor-Leste, and Vietnam. Southeast Asia is notably known for its ability to build up from industries like commerce to political influence internationally. Following the decolonization processes of each state within the mid-20th century, this region strongly advocates for stability and maintaining its cooperation with sovereignty amid Cold War pressures.",
        constraints: "Countries spanning from two of the biggest oceans in the world are characterized by countries with thousands of Islands, rainforests, and neighbouring routes to the South China Sea. Colonial legacies in Southeast Asia have left political systems and disparities within sectors, including economically, despite the differing ethnic and religious diversity became a problem for national integration, constraining approaches to diplomacy and international security.",
        whyMatters: "Southeast Asia, under the pressure of Western intervention during the 20th century, had to face immediate responses to external pressure through cooperation between states. These countries showcased collaborative efforts without confrontation and managed to push through under regional bodies and non-interference mechanisms to maintain stability under differing geopolitical environments."

        brief: "Europe for decades has been known to be the central arena for contending world peace and frequently defends its own national interests to control political, economic, to ideological transformation of other states. Europe contains 44 countries to this day, spanning from Switzerland to Liechtenstein, which has now shaped the existing ideologies of Industrialisation and nationalism after their damage to controlled countries. Europe and the European Union stand as different, varying parties as current EU candidates and EFTA Member States exist, however, there are permanent EU Member States which are officially the main countries a part of the European territory.",
        constraints: "Europe is extremely dense and closely situated, with a history of frequently controlling other territorial regions throughout the world. The aftermath of major wars required decisions that balanced accountability, reconstruction, and long-term peace, often with unintended consequences.",
        whyMatters: "Europe did control a proportion of the world, Europe did create transformative ideologies within countries miles away, and Europe managed to highlight how control and territorial urges under crisis could lead to force withdrawal. Europe's diplomatic efforts and dialogues between solutions and treaties to address the past provide valuable lessons on diplomacy, post-conflict reconstruction, and the risks of prioritising short-term political objectives over sustainable peace."

        title: "Africa",
        brief: "Africa’s current modern political stances and governmental stance were significantly created by the colonialism done by Europe within the late 19th century up until the early twentieth century. Africa consists of 54 separate states recognized by the United Nations, varying from countries like Morocco to Sao Tome and Principe. The European empire ruled and colonized Africa, causing the separation of these sovereign states to be unorganised societies, inflated economies, and governance structures, often prioritising external interests over local realities. Africa only saw a turn within the mid-20th century after Independence movements to transition into self-governance despite the damage done by external actors.",
        constraints: "Artificial borders were drawn during the ruling, shaping the current 54 states we can see on the world map within the African region. The separation and ruling after being left by European rulers frequently disregarded ethnic, linguistic, and cultural boundaries. This leads to permanent constraints as these independent states are now more vulnerable to creating long-term political and social peace measures. Diversity between resources, from deserts to rainforests, combined with uneven resource distribution, further complicated state-building and governance with one another inside this region.",
        whyMatters: "Africa provides an image of the long-term consequences of externally imposed decisions, which were deemed irrational as the policies and colonial rule by external intervention led to barriers, especially within trade. However, Africa was able to collaborate through regional partners and dialogue, assembling Scramble for Africa."
